______________
The project titled “50 MW Bundled Wind Project by Surya Vidyut Ltd in Gujarat & Rajasthan” is
located in the Surendranagar district of Gujarat and the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan. It consists of 26
MW in Gujarat and 24 MW in Rajasthan, involving the supply, erection, commissioning, and operation
of 25 wind turbine generators (WTGs), each with a rated capacity of 2000 kW. All WTGs are of the
Inox 2000DF model. The project is owned by Surya Vidyut Ltd, hereinafter referred to as the Project
Proponent (PP).

Purpose of the project activity:
Surya Vidyut Ltd has installed 50 MW wind farm in the state of Gujarat & Rajasthan in India. Inox
Renewables & Surya Vidyut Ltd is the equipment supplier and the operations and maintenance
contractor for the Project. There are 25 Wind Energy Convertors (“WEC’s”) of with rated capacity 2000
kW each. The generated electricity is supplied to Electricity Distribution Company (DISCOM) under a
long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). The expected operational lifetime of the project is for 25
years. The project being a renewable energy generation activity, leads to reduction in fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation from the Indian grid.

The purpose of the project activity is to generate emission free and environment friendly electricity
from the wind energy potential available in the region. The project is expected to generate and supply 3
1,14,563 MWh of electricity annually to the Indian grid. The project thus addresses the demand–supply
gap in the state of Rajasthan & Gujarat and will assist the sustainable growth, conservation of resources
and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy source like wind energy. The
project activity will contribute towards reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from the
atmosphere, which has been estimated to be approximately 101,742 tCO2e per year, by displacing an
equivalent amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid
comprising mainly of fossil fuel-based power plants. Thus, the project does not only reduce the
demand-supply gap of the respective grid, but also helps in reducing other pollutants like SOx, NOx,
etc. from the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated from the connected/ new power plants in the Indian grid, which are/ will be
predominantly based on fossil fuels.

This is also the pre-project scenario. The technology employed for the project is well proven and safe.
Relevant dates for the project activity (e.g. Site, commissioning, continued operation periods, etc.):
The WECs under the project activity were commissioned between 13/03/2013 and 31/12/2014. The
expected operational lifetime of the project is for 25 years.

PRIOR HISTORY

The project ensures the prevention of double counting through the following measures:
 It is uniquely identified by its geographic coordinates, a dedicated commissioning
certificate, and a specific grid connection point.
 Exclusive energy meters are installed and linked directly to the project activit’s consumption
points.

Out of the total 50 MW bundled capacity, 24 MW located in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan, was
initially considered for registration under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) (LINK: https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/Validation/DB/XMD6WXCXLV04Q5YZYWC1SVJZEZBD1W/view.html). 

However, the project proponent did not proceed with CDM registration, and the project remains unregistered
under CDM. The project activity is seeking verification exclusively under UCR and has not sought
registration under any other GHG program, except CDM, which was not pursued. No validations,
verifications, or issuances have occurred, ensuring no risk of double-counting of COUs.
